There are five objects on the screen: a green sphere, a celeste sphere, a purple sphere, a yellow tetrahedron constructed by four triangles, and a rectangular plane. The bounding box is set to have xmax = ymax = zmax = 10, xmin = ymin = zmin = -10. 

To enable the interface, point the mouse on the screen and click "i". Then the terminal should produce instructions on how to change a particular variable or print specific information. Everything in the interface should be clear and easy to use. Feel free to change any variable but be sure to not change value beyond expected range.
